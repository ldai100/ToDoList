# ToDoList

This project is to help myself familiarize with Android development and for application process.


plan:

1) I will first follow a online tutorial to build a basic app to build a to-do-list app.

2) I will read through the codes and understand the structure as well as the libraries used.

3) I will modify the codes to make it my own as well as let it meet project requirements.
